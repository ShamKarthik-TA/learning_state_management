# React State Management Workshop

This workspace contains three separate projects demonstrating different global state management approaches in React:

- **react-context-api/** ‚Äì Uses React Context API
- **redux-toolkit-sample/** ‚Äì Uses Redux Toolkit
- **zustand-latest-sample/** ‚Äì Uses Zustand

---

## üóÇÔ∏è What Each Folder Shows

- **react-context-api/**: Visualizes Context API usage, common pitfalls, and best practices.
- **redux-toolkit-sample/**: Demonstrates Redux Toolkit setup, usage, and typical boilerplate.
- **zustand-latest-sample/**: Shows Zustand's minimal API, selectors, and async caveats.

Each project contains hands-on examples and visual demos for learning and comparison.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Branches in This Repo

- **main** ‚Äì The default branch with all stable, working examples and slides.
- **cons-and-fix** ‚Äì Contains examples and demos focused on common pitfalls (cons) and fixes for each state management approach.
- **add-to-cart-implemented** ‚Äì Implements the activity context and cart functionality with a step-by-step guide for Context API.

Switch branches using:
```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
```

## üöÄ Detailed Setup Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js v18 or above ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### 2. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already, clone this workspace:
```sh
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
For each project, run:
```sh
cd <project-folder>
npm install
```
Replace `<project-folder>` with one of:
- `react-context-api`
- `redux-toolkit-sample`
- `zustand-latest-sample`

### 4. Start the Dev Server
Inside the chosen project folder, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```
This will start the Vite development server. Open the local URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) to view the app.

### 5. Explore the Code
- Each project has a `README.md` explaining its structure and key files.
- Try editing components or stores to see how state management works.

### 6. Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about missing packages, run `npm install` again in the project folder.
- If the dev server port is in use, try `npm run dev -- --port=3000` to use a different port.
- For issues with Node.js versions, check with `node -v` and update if needed.

### 7. Using Online Editors
- You can also open each project in [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) for instant online editing (no install needed).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Recommended Editor
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** ‚Äì Free, fast, and feature-rich for JavaScript/React development.
  - [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Useful VS Code Extensions
- **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets** ‚Äì Fast React code snippets
- **Prettier** ‚Äì Code formatter for consistent style
- **ESLint** ‚Äì Linting for JavaScript/React
- **Vite** ‚Äì Vite support for fast dev server
- **Marp for VS Code** ‚Äì For viewing/editing Marp slides

### Node.js & npm
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- npm comes bundled with Node.js
- Check versions:
  ```sh
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

### Project Setup Steps
1. Clone the repo and open in VS Code
2. Open a terminal in the project folder
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the Vite dev server
5. Open the local URL in your browser

### Tips
- Use VS Code's integrated terminal for all commands
- Use the "Go Live" or "Preview" extensions for live browser reloads
- Use the Marp extension to preview slides (`global-state-comparison.marp.md`)
- Use Prettier and ESLint to keep code clean and consistent

## ü§ñ Using GitHub Copilot to Generate State Management Code

You can use GitHub Copilot to help you scaffold and implement state management logic in any of these projects. Here‚Äôs how:

### 1. Install Copilot Extension
- In VS Code, go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`)
- Search for "GitHub Copilot" and install it
- Sign in with your GitHub account if prompted

### 2. Enable Copilot in Your Project
- Open any file (e.g., a new context, slice, or store file)
- Start typing a comment describing what you want, e.g.:
  ```js
  // Create a React context for cart state with add/remove functions
  ```
- Copilot will suggest code completions. Press `Tab` to accept, or cycle through suggestions.

### 3. Example Prompts
- `// Create a Redux slice for todo state with add/remove actions`
- `// Zustand store for user authentication state`
- `// React context for theme switching`

### 4. Tips
- Be specific in your comments for better suggestions
- Use Copilot to generate boilerplate, then customize as needed
- Review Copilot‚Äôs code for correctness and best practices
